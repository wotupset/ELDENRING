```
This way, Tarnished. May I have a word?




A pleasure to meet thee, Tarnished. 
I am the witch Renna.
I'd heard tell of a Tarnished hurtling about atop a spectral steed.
And upon looking into the matter, the talk, I surmise, is of thee.
Thou'rt possessed of the power, no?
To call forth the spectral steed named Torrent.


[i can call the spectral steed]

Ah. As I had hoped. 
I was entrusted this, for thee. 
By Torrent's former master.
Tis a bell for calling forth spirits. Summon them with it, from ash unreturned to the Erdtree.
The spirits will obey thine command but briefly, as they recall battles past.
Now it is thine. To do with as thou wishest.
